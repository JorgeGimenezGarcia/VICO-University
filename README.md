## Introduction

This repository contains a series of projects related to Computer Vision, including image processing, object detection, and more. Each project is organized in its respective directory with detailed explanations and code.

## Projects

Here are some of the key projects included in this repository:

1. **Image Classification**: Implementing various algorithms to classify images into predefined categories. [View Notebook](https://github.com/JorgeGimenezGarcia/VICO-University/blob/main/Image_Classification.ipynb)
2. **Object Detection**: Detecting and localizing objects within images using techniques like YOLO and SSD. [View Notebook](https://github.com/JorgeGimenezGarcia/VICO-University/blob/main/Object_Detection.ipynb)
3. **Image Segmentation**: Segmenting images to identify different regions or objects. [View Notebook](https://github.com/JorgeGimenezGarcia/VICO-University/blob/main/Image_Segmentation.ipynb)
4. **Feature Extraction**: Extracting meaningful features from images for analysis. [View Notebook](https://github.com/JorgeGimenezGarcia/VICO-University/blob/main/Feature_Extraction.ipynb)
5. **Deep Learning Models**: Training neural networks for various Computer Vision tasks. [View Notebook](https://github.com/JorgeGimenezGarcia/VICO-University/blob/main/Deep_Learning_Models.ipynb)
